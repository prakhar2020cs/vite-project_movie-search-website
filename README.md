## Features

- **Search:** Users can search for movies by entering keywords.
- **API Integration:** The app retrieves movie data from an external API.
- **Favorite Movies:** Users can mark movies as favorites and manage their favorites list.
- **User Interaction:** Intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction.

  # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
